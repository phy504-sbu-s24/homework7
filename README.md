1. In our [debugging
   experiment](https://zingale.github.io/phy504/debugging.html), we
   looked at the trapezoid rule for integration.

   Given a function, $f(x)$, defined on $[a, b]$, we divide the domain
   into $N$ slabs, and the integral is approximated as:

   $$I = \frac{1}{2} \Delta x \sum_{i=1}^N \left ( f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1}) \right )

   where $\Delta x$ is the width of a slab and $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ are the
   coordinates of the left and right edge of slab $i$.
